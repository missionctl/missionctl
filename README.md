MissionCTL
==========

Control your ROS robot via the web!

Introduction
------------

MissionCTL (pronounced “Mission Control”) is a web application that enables 
engineers to remote-control robots running the Robot Operating System (ROS). 
Normally this is done by running some console commands from the Unix terminal, 
but the two problems with that are:

- Not everyone knows how to use the Unix terminal and
- Not everyone has access to a Unix machine all the time

With MissionCTL, you’ll be able to control your robots via your web browser on 
your computer, tablet, or mobile phone. Send and receive messages to and from 
the robot, subscribe to topics, create and manage nodes, the possibilities are 
endless!

Development is just beginning, and there’s a long way to go before even an 
alpha version is ready. But we’ve got the resources in place to make this a 
really great product! Here’s the best thing of all: MissionCTL is 100% 
open-source and 100% free. And it always will be.
